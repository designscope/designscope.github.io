### Abstract

### Goals

- **Augmented Memory**
   - phone numbers, addresses, project templates, all at your fingertips across all devices.
- **Zero Knowledge**
   - no cloud, think of a system *a la* crypto wallet or 1password vault
- **Last Mile**
   - application runs on all major systems (mac, linux, windows) and mobiles (android, iphone, as a keyboard)
- **Modular**
   - user shops for and subscribes to new packages (computer languages, medical terminology, etc)
- **Assistive**
   - System builds a personalized tutorial based on new, updated or seldom used macros so user idolizes their wallet.

### Audiences

- **Developers**
- **Clerical**
   - Anyone who spends a lot of time answering messages and talking to public.
- **Medical/Techical/Legal professionals**
   - Groups who use technical terminology.

### Challenges

- **Compelling Examples**
  - macros are _really_ powerful, and exocortex needs to provide compelling examples to convey possibilities.
- **Fragmented Market**
  - macros are used by niche audiences, under different names and conventions. Exocortex macros should either follow or become an industry standard, with conversion tools.
- **Proper Mental Model**
   - macros are highly technical, its possibilities only understood after users become experienced. A proper mental model is needed for users to anticipate what they can do with it.
- **Last Mile**
   - Establishing a presence on all major systems is an ongoing struggle. not only normalizing onboarding in different systems but keeping up-to-date with updates thst may affect usage.

### monetization Possibilities

- Organization Mode
  - **Privacy**
  - **Team Management**
     - absolute control of which team members receives which package. Absolute control of who's in and who's out.
  - **Top-Down Subscription**
     - Admin creates new packages, chooses teams, and team members receive it automatically.
  - **Automatic Update**
     - Team members receive updates automatically, ensuring company standards are always current.

### Possibilities

- letter templates
- Any kind of decision trees (customer service, troubleshooting, procedures)
- complex syntax

### Next Steps

- list of research
  - competition (walkthrough of existing autocompletes, snippets)
  - security
  - user research
