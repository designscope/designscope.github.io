Design Scope is a framework for understanding, creating, and implementing a holistic approach design problems and projects. 
It is intended to expose aspects of the design process that tend to be opaque or otherwise obscure and make them more accessible to project teams and stakeholders. 

Currently, design is treated as a black box process moderated and controlled by visionaries who have a special set of esoteric skills that somehow cannot be explained.
Without intellectual access to these black box processes, developers demand to go straight to code, because there is no apparent or immediate value in system, legal, environmental, or human research. 
These are all, instead, handled post hoc.

Design Scope focuses the attention of teams instead on critical steps through a systemic design process that transparently weighs and evaluates human needs, legal and environmental constraints, and structural considerations.
